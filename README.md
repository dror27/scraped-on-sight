# scraped-on-sight

Scraping sites and documents using command line tools - mostly upon request. Scraping sessions are documented in a video, which articats (files, etc) saved in repo.

If you want a site scraped please create an issue similar to this one: https://github.com/dror27/scraped-on-sight/issues/1

Scraping is done on MacOS and should be equality accessible for Linux users. Windows users should install linux/bash command line tools.

The goal is to document real-life scraping sessions, including setbacks and wrong turns. In most cases, the initial scraping session is documented.

Enjoy
